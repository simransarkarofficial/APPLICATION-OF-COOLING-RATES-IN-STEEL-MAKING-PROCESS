# APPLICATION-OF-COOLING-RATES-IN-STEEL-MAKING-PROCESS

This repository contains a literature review project on the influence of cooling rates on steel microstructures and mechanical properties.

## Overview
The project explores how different cooling rates (quenching, air cooling, furnace cooling) affect the formation of phases such as martensite, bainite, and pearlite in steels like AISI 1020, 1040, and 1060. The study was based entirely on published research papers and compiled into a presentation.
